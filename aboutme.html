<img src="Screenshot 2022-05-20 121951.png">
<p class="writing">Logan Watral was born in San Francisco, California to Michelle Lee and William Watral. He grew up in Piedmont, California, and is currently attending Piedmont High School. In his spare time, he enjoys writing and recording music, playing piano, guitar, bass, drums, and saxophone. When not working on new music, he works on improving his woodworking, especially that focused on the crafting of electric guitars and basses so he can start a small business building custom electric guitars. He is hoping to finish the semester with a 4.0 GPA and start playing music live this year.
